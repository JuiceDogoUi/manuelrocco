# SEI Novus: Building UX Practice from Zero

**Category:** Designed

## The Hook

I walked into a Swiss fintech with no UX process and built one from scratch. Over 16 months, I conducted 25+ user interviews, ran 15+ usability tests, and transformed how a development team of [X] people ships product.

## The Puzzle

SEI Novus had talented engineers building sophisticated financial tools. What they lacked was any structured way to understand users. Features shipped based on stakeholder assumptions. Nobody talked to customers before coding. Usability issues surfaced after launch, not before. The team wanted to improve but had no framework for getting there. They needed someone to build the practice, not just practice the craft.

## Your Decision

I chose to embed research into existing workflows rather than create a separate UX silo. The trade-off: slower initial progress while I trained the team, but sustainable adoption long-term. I could have run all research myself and delivered findings. Instead, I brought engineers into interviews and taught PMs to facilitate usability tests. This meant the practice would survive without me.

## What Changed

- Established a continuous discovery cadence with 25+ customer interviews over 16 months
- Created and ran 15+ usability tests, catching critical issues before development
- Introduced design sprints to align cross-functional teams on complex features
- Built a research repository so insights accumulated rather than disappeared
- Led retrospectives that connected user feedback to sprint priorities

## The Result

The team went from zero user research to monthly customer contact. Usability issues caught in testing dropped rework requests by [X%]. Design sprints reduced alignment meetings by [X hours] per feature. Two PMs and three engineers now run their own research sessions.

## What I'd Do Differently

I would establish executive buy-in earlier. Mid-level adoption was strong, but leadership engagement came late. Starting with a C-suite presentation on research ROI would have accelerated resource allocation and cross-team adoption.
