# SEI Novus Analytics Dashboard: From Ignored to Indispensable

**Category:** Designed

## The Hook

I took a dashboard with 5% interaction rate and rebuilt it to 70%. That is a 14x increase in user engagement. A tool financial professionals ignored became one they could not work without.

## The Puzzle

SEI Novus had built powerful analytics capabilities, but nobody was using them. The dashboard sat in the product, technically functional, practically invisible. Only 5% of users ever interacted with it. The problem was not the data. The problem was presentation. Complex financial metrics were displayed in dense tables with no visual hierarchy. Users opened the dashboard, felt overwhelmed, and closed it. Millions in development investment was gathering dust.

## Your Decision

I chose to rebuild around user workflows rather than data structures. Engineers had designed the dashboard to mirror the database schema. I redesigned it to mirror how analysts actually think. The trade-off: significant development effort to restructure the front-end, but without it, we were maintaining a feature nobody valued. I proposed an iterative rollout, proving value with core users before expanding scope.

## What Changed

- Replaced dense data tables with interactive visualizations that surfaced insights at a glance
- Reorganized the information architecture around analyst workflows, not data categories
- Added contextual filtering so users could drill down without leaving their mental model
- Designed progressive disclosure patterns that revealed complexity only when needed
- Conducted usability testing with 8 financial analysts to validate each iteration

## The Result

Interaction rate jumped from 5% to 70% within six weeks of launch. Users who previously ignored the dashboard began incorporating it into daily workflows. Support tickets related to analytics dropped by 40%. The redesigned dashboard became a selling point in client demos.

## What I'd Do Differently

I would push for usage analytics from day one on the original design. We discovered the 5% interaction rate late. If we had instrumented properly at launch, we could have caught the problem months earlier and saved both user frustration and development cycles.
