# invoo.es: From Market Gap to Production Code

**Category:** Built

## The Hook

I co-founded and shipped an invoice management tool now used by [X] Spanish freelancers. I designed every screen, built the Next.js marketing site and Angular front-end, and went from zero to paying users in [X months].

## The Puzzle

Spanish freelancers face a compliance nightmare. Tax regulations are complex, existing invoicing tools feel like they were built in 2005, and none of them understand what solo workers actually need: speed, simplicity, and peace of mind. We saw freelancers wasting hours on administrative tasks that should take minutes. The market was ripe for a modern solution built by people who understood the pain firsthand.

## Your Decision

I chose to own the entire user-facing experience: design and front-end development. This meant context-switching between Figma and code daily, but it eliminated handoff friction and let me iterate faster. The trade-off was clear. I could have focused on just design and shipped more features, but owning both layers meant every interaction felt intentional. When I spotted a UX issue in testing, I fixed it in code that same afternoon.

## What Changed

- Designed and built a streamlined invoice creation flow that takes under 2 minutes
- Shipped a Next.js marketing site optimized for Spanish SEO and conversion
- Built the Angular dashboard with real-time invoice tracking and status updates
- Created automated Spanish tax calculation logic that handles compliance automatically
- Established the visual design system that scales as we add features

## The Result

[X] freelancers now use invoo.es to manage their invoicing. Average invoice creation dropped from [X minutes] to under 2 minutes. We achieved [X%] month-over-month growth in our first [X months], with a [X%] user retention rate.

## What I'd Do Differently

I would validate pricing earlier. We spent weeks perfecting features before testing willingness to pay. Next time, I am running pricing experiments in week one, not month three.
