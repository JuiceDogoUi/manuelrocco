# DataCamp Mobile Home: Faster to First Lesson

**Category:** Designed

## The Hook

I cut one second from DataCamp's mobile home screen and drove a 7% increase in learning activity. By redesigning what millions of users see first, I reduced bounce rates by 10% and got learners into courses faster.

## The Puzzle

DataCamp's mobile home screen was a bottleneck. Nearly 1 in 10 users (9.3%) landed on the home screen and left without taking any action. They scrolled, they browsed, but they did not learn. The existing layout buried the most important content under promotional banners and generic recommendations. Users spent 9 seconds orienting themselves before doing anything meaningful. Every second of friction was a learner we might lose.

## Your Decision

I chose to prioritize learning resumption over discovery. The trade-off: less real estate for new course promotion, but faster paths to active courses. Stakeholders worried about reducing visibility for new content launches. I argued that users who never start learning cannot be upsold. Data showed our highest-value users were returners who wanted to pick up where they left off. I optimized for their workflow first.

## What Changed

- Elevated "Continue Learning" to the top of the home screen, making course resumption one tap away
- Redesigned the visual hierarchy to guide eyes toward action, not exploration
- Reduced cognitive load by grouping related content and removing decorative elements
- Simplified navigation patterns based on session replay analysis
- A/B tested the new layout against control with millions of users

## The Result

Users leaving without action dropped from 9.3% to 8.4%, a 10% improvement. XP gained through courses increased 7%, meaning more users completed more lessons. Time to first meaningful action dropped from 9 to 8 seconds. The redesign became the permanent mobile experience.

## What I'd Do Differently

I would prototype more variations earlier. We converged on a solution quickly based on strong hypotheses, but testing a wider range of layouts might have revealed even bigger wins. Next time, I am running three concepts in parallel before committing.
