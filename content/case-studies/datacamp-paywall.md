# DataCamp Paywall: 50% Conversion Lift From Deleting a Feature

**Category:** Led
**Role:** Product Manager & Lead Product Designer
**Year:** 2025

## The Hook

Two-thirds of users never saw our paywall. They bounced on a screen designed to prepare them for it. The screen was doing its job, just not the job we needed. So I proposed deleting it entirely.

## The Puzzle

DataCamp handed me an open brief: find paywall opportunities on mobile. No hypothesis, no target metric, just go look. So I mapped every path a user could take after completing their first chapter.

The end-of-chapter screen offered three options:

- **70%** tapped "Start Next Chapter"
- **20%** tapped "Practice"
- **6%** tapped "Home" and never saw any conversion flow

That 70% was our main funnel. But tapping "Start Next Chapter" did not show the paywall. It showed a pre-paywall screen first: a generic title, a description, and a button to continue. Of everyone who landed on this screen:

- **30%** tapped "Close" and never saw the real paywall
- **35%** tapped "Home" and left
- Only **32%** tapped "Get Unlimited Access" and actually reached the paywall

The math was brutal: 65% of users bounced at the pre-paywall before ever seeing prices.

> **Data Insight:** 65% of users bounced at the pre-paywall. Only 32% ever reached the real paywall.

## The Decision

My first instinct was to personalize the pre-paywall. The screen was generic: a title, a description, a button. No context about what the user had just learned or what they would unlock.

Then I stopped and asked a different question: Why have a pre-paywall at all?

If we could personalize the content, why not personalize the actual paywall directly? The pre-paywall was an extra step we had invented. Users who reached the paywall converted fine. The problem was the friction getting there.

I proposed killing the screen entirely. Paywall changes are sensitive territory. Touch the wrong thing and you risk revenue. But the data was too clear to ignore, and PM and growth leads aligned once they saw the funnel breakdown.

## The Approach

The solution had two parts, both shipped in a single sprint. First, plug the leak: I removed the "Home" button from the post-chapter screen. That 6% of users who tapped Home and vanished now had to choose between continuing their learning or practicing. Both paths eventually reached the paywall.

Second, eliminate the bottleneck: I removed the pre-paywall screen entirely. Users who tapped "Start Next Chapter" now went straight to the paywall. No intermediary. No "warming up." Just a direct path to the decision point. I kept the "Practice" option because practice is core to DataCamp's mobile value proposition. Removing it would have damaged the product experience for a marginal conversion gain.

## The Result

We ran an A/B test. The treatment group converted at **7.36%** compared to **4.90%** for control. A **50% lift in subscription conversions**, statistically significant with 95% confidence.

One sprint to build. One month to validate and ship permanently. This flow is now the default. Every new paywall test starts here.

> **Key Result:** 4.90% → 7.36% conversion rate. 50% lift. Statistically significant.

## What I'd Do Differently

This project had the ingredients I thrive on: freedom to explore the data, space to question assumptions, and a fast path from insight to shipped solution. I wish more projects worked this way. Give me a real problem, access to data, and room to move quickly. I love this stuff.

If I had more time, I would track long-term retention alongside conversion to ensure we didn't just pull forward purchases that would have happened anyway. And I would follow up by redesigning the paywall itself. It's crowded, generic, and doesn't reflect what the user just learned or what they're about to unlock. There's more conversion lift sitting there.

> **Key Lesson:** Data tells you what is happening. Asking "why does this exist?" tells you what to do about it.
