# DataCamp Paywall: Killing a Feature to Boost Conversions

**Category:** Led

## The Hook

I eliminated half of DataCamp's paywall flow and increased paywall views by 50%. That single decision, removing a screen instead of adding one, drove a [X%] lift in subscription conversions across millions of users.

## The Puzzle

Half of our users were vanishing before they ever saw the real paywall. The culprit: a "pre-paywall" screen that showed learning insights before presenting subscription options. In theory, it built value. In reality, it created friction. Users landed there, saw content they could not access, and bounced. We were losing potential subscribers at the exact moment we should have been converting them.

## Your Decision

I proposed something counterintuitive: delete the pre-paywall entirely. The data showed users who reached the actual paywall converted at healthy rates. The problem was getting them there. Stakeholders worried we would lose the "value demonstration" moment. I argued that momentum mattered more than persuasion at this stage. Users already knew what they wanted. We just needed to stop blocking the path.

## What Changed

- Removed the pre-paywall insights screen from the conversion flow
- Streamlined the user journey from free content to subscription prompt
- Ran A/B tests across user segments to validate the hypothesis
- Collaborated with engineering to ensure clean analytics tracking
- Documented the decision framework for future paywall experiments

## The Result

Paywall views jumped 50% immediately after launch. Subscription conversions increased by [X%], translating to [X] additional subscribers per month. The simplified flow became the new baseline for all monetization experiments.

## What I'd Do Differently

I would push for a faster testing cycle. The A/B test ran longer than necessary because we wanted statistical confidence on secondary metrics. The primary signal was clear within two weeks. I now advocate for staged rollouts with kill switches over extended test periods.
