## DataCamp: Paywall Conversion Optimization

**Tags**: #conversion #experimentation #B2C #subscription #growth #mobile #data-driven
**Best for**: Growth roles, B2C companies, data-driven teams, product-minded design roles
**Impact level**: High - flagship case study with clear metrics

### Situation
DataCamp's mobile paywall had a hidden problem: 65% of users never saw it. They bounced on a "pre-paywall" screen that was supposed to prepare them for the upgrade offer. The screen showed a generic title, description, and button—no context about what the user learned or what they'd unlock.

### Task
Find paywall opportunities on mobile. Open brief, no hypothesis, no target metric—just investigate and identify where we were losing potential subscribers.

### Action
- Mapped every user path after completing their first chapter
- Discovered the brutal math: only 32% of users who started the conversion funnel actually reached the paywall
- Asked the fundamental question: "Why does this pre-paywall screen exist at all?"
- Proposed deleting the screen entirely instead of trying to optimize it
- Built stakeholder alignment by presenting the funnel breakdown data
- Shipped in one sprint: removed pre-paywall screen + plugged secondary leak (Home button)

### Result
- **50% lift in subscription conversions** (4.90% → 7.36%)
- Statistically significant with 95% confidence
- One sprint to build, one month to validate
- Now the default flow; every new paywall test starts here

### Key Quote
"The best way to fix a friction point is often to delete it."

## DataCamp: Mobile Home Screen Restructure

**Tags**: #product-strategy #information-architecture #mobile #B2C #experimentation #mental-models
**Best for**: Product design leadership, UX strategy, consumer apps, mobile-first roles
**Impact level**: High - strategic bet that paid off

### Situation
9.3% of users opened the DataCamp mobile home screen and did nothing. The screen organized content by course type (Python, SQL, etc.), but users don't think in courses—they think in actions: "I have 10 minutes, what can I do right now?"

### Task
Reduce bounce rate and increase engagement by making the home screen match how users actually think about learning.

### Action
- Made a design bet based on observation and competitor analysis (Duolingo, Mimo, Brilliant), not research studies
- Restructured entire screen around three verbs: learn, practice, review
- Built the case by mapping user jobs to actions, not courses
- Created distinct entry points for each action type
- Applied new design system with modern animations and shimmer loaders
- One designer, one PM, one clear direction

### Result
- **10% bounce rate reduction** (9.3% → 8.4%)
- **7% course engagement lift**
- Time to action: 9s → 8s (users found their path faster)
- Defended design when overall XP dipped 2.4%—investigated and proved it was an implementation gap (empty practice modals), not design failure
- Became foundation for all subsequent home screen iterations

### Key Quote
"Every user job mapped to an action, not a course. That was the argument that won."

## invoo.es: Co-founding an Invoicing Tool

**Tags**: #founder #0-to-1 #B2B #SaaS #frontend #go-to-market #content-marketing
**Best for**: Founder/builder roles, startup environments, full-stack design roles, entrepreneurial cultures
**Impact level**: High - demonstrates end-to-end ownership

### Situation
Spain announced mandatory digital invoicing for freelancers and small businesses. Existing tools complied with regulations but tried to do everything—cluttered interfaces, confusing workflows, features nobody asked for. Worse, they charged users to connect with accountants.

### Task
Build an invoicing tool focused on speed and simplicity. Co-founded with a backend engineer; I owned everything user-facing.

### Action
- Spent weeks in freelancer communities (X, Reddit) identifying pain points
- Designed and built entire frontend
- Pivoted tech stack mid-build (React/Next.js → Angular/Java) to qualify as official AEAT API provider
- Executed content-led GTM: wrote guides solving real tax questions, posted to communities, converted readers to waitlist signups
- No pitch, just value—helped hundreds of freelancers before announcing product

### Result
- **80 waitlist signups** in two months, zero ad spend
- 10 beta testers creating real invoices daily
- Invoice creation: **10 minutes → 30 seconds**
- 15+ hours saved per year per user (~600 EUR value)
- Public launch coming soon

### Key Quote
"Sometimes slowing down is the faster path." (on the tech stack pivot)
