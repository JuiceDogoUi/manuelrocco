## Positioning Statements

### Current (Casual/Modern Voice)
I've spent almost 15 years making digital products that don't make people want to throw their laptops out the window. I work across B2B and B2C, usually when things are beautifully chaotic (early stage) or when they're growing faster than anyone planned for (scaling). My specialty? Taking something complicated and making it simple.

I lead design teams, but I'm terrible at staying in my lane. When it's useful, I jump into product strategy, help decide what we're shipping and why, and work with engineering and business to actually get it out the door.

These days, I let AI handle the tedious bits (research, specs, data crunching, coding). Gives me more time to focus on finding the right opportunities, building things people actually want, and making sure it all makes business sense.

### Formal/Traditional
A strategic UX leader with more than 14 years of experience in digital products at startups, corporates, and agencies. I proactively transform opportunities into solutions and am dedicated to fostering a culture of user-centered thinking across organizations to achieve outstanding UX design performance.
