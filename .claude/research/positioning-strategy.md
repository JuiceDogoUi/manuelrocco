# Positioning Strategy: The Multi-Disciplinary Product Builder

## Executive Summary

The market has shifted dramatically. The "unicorn" designer-developer-PM hybrid that was once a fantasy is now becoming the expected archetype for high-value individual contributors. Your timing is excellent, but the positioning requires careful calibration.

---

## 1. Target Audience Analysis

### Audience A: Traditional Design + Product Leader Positioning

**Who hires this person:**
- Established tech companies (Series C+, enterprise)
- Design agencies expanding into product strategy
- Companies with mature design teams needing leadership

**Their needs:**
- Proven track record managing teams
- Strategic vision + design craft
- Stakeholder management skills
- Predictable, low-risk hires

**Psychographics:**
- Risk-averse hiring managers
- Value credentials and tenure
- Measure success by team output, not individual velocity
- Often work within HR constraints that require "standard" titles

**Pain points:**
- Previous design leaders were too tactical or too strategic (not both)
- Need someone who can "speak business" to executives
- Tired of designers who cannot influence product direction

---

### Audience B: 3-in-1 Builder Positioning

**Who hires this person:**
- Early-stage startups (Seed to Series B)
- Venture studios and incubators
- Founders needing a "first product hire"
- Innovation teams within enterprises
- Companies building AI-native products

**Their needs:**
- Speed over process
- Someone who can ship, not just spec
- Reduced coordination overhead
- Strategic thinking combined with tactical execution

**Psychographics:**
- Founder-minded (even if they work at a company)
- Value velocity and ownership
- Comfortable with ambiguity
- See traditional role boundaries as friction

**Pain points:**
- Cannot afford to hire 3 specialists
- Frustrated by handoff delays between design and engineering
- Need someone who can validate ideas quickly through working prototypes
- Want strategic input, not just execution

---

## 2. Competitive Alternatives Analysis

When companies do not hire this person, what do they do instead?

### For Traditional Design + Product Role:

| Alternative | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Pure Design Leader | Deep craft expertise | Cannot own product strategy |
| PM with design taste | Business context | Designs are "PM quality" |
| Design Director from agency | Creative vision | May struggle with tech product constraints |

### For 3-in-1 Builder Role:

| Alternative | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Full-stack engineer | Ships code fast | Design is afterthought |
| Designer + Engineer pair | Specialization | 2x cost, coordination overhead |
| No-code builder | Fast prototypes | Limited customization, technical debt |
| Design Engineer | Design + code | Often lacks product/strategy layer |
| AI-assisted non-technical founder | Can ship with AI tools | No design foundation, quality issues |

**Key Insight:** The design engineer role is hot right now, but most design engineers are positioned as craft practitioners (design systems, interaction details). Few position themselves as strategic product thinkers who also execute. This is your gap.

## 3. Unique Differentiators Analysis

### The 3-in-1 Value Proposition

**What the combination enables:**

1. **Zero-Latency Iteration**
   - Traditional: Design -> Handoff -> Dev review -> Questions -> Revised design -> Build -> QA -> Feedback -> Redesign
   - 3-in-1: Think -> Design -> Build -> Ship (same person, same day)
   - Value: 10x faster feedback loops

2. **Strategic Execution**
   - Can translate business goals directly into shipped product
   - No "telephone game" between PM, designer, and engineer
   - Decisions account for technical feasibility in real-time

3. **Capital Efficiency**
   - One person doing the work of 2-3 specialists
   - Research shows solo founders with AI tools match output of 3-4 FTEs
   - Critical for startups where runway is everything

4. **AI-Native Workflow**
   - Using Claude Code with sub-agents is not "writing code"—it is orchestrating AI to execute vision
   - This is a fundamentally new skill that most designers and PMs have not developed
   - The tool is not the differentiator; the workflow and judgment are

**What problems this solves:**

- "We need to move faster but cannot afford more headcount"
- "Our designers spec things that are impossible to build"
- "Our engineers build things that are unusable"
- "We need someone who can own a product area end-to-end"
- "We are building with AI and need someone who understands both the tools and the user experience"

## 4. Positioning Statement Options

### Option A: "Design Leader Who Ships"

**For** product-focused companies who need senior design leadership,

**I am the** Lead Product Designer

**who** bridges strategy and execution by actually shipping front-end code,

**because** 7+ years of design leadership at companies like DataCamp, combined with hands-on building at my startup invoo.es, means you get strategic thinking that never loses touch with implementation reality.

**Only-ness Statement:** "I am the only design leader who can take a product from whiteboard to production without handoffs."

**Best for:** Design leadership roles at mid-stage companies who value the coding skill as a bonus but are primarily hiring for design leadership.

---

### Option B: "The Product Builder"

**For** early-stage startups and innovation teams who need to ship fast without building a full team,

**I am the** Product Builder

**who** combines design, product strategy, and front-end execution into one person,

**because** as co-founder of invoo.es, I handle everything from business strategy to shipping code—and I bring that same end-to-end ownership to any product I work on.

**Only-ness Statement:** "I am the only product hire who can replace your first designer, first PM, and first front-end engineer—all with senior-level output."

**Best for:** Startups, venture studios, or founding product roles where the job is to "make the product exist."

---

### Option C: "AI-Native Design Strategist" (Emerging Category)

**For** companies building AI-first products who need someone who understands both the AI tooling revolution and how to design for humans,

**I am the** AI-Native Design Strategist

**who** uses AI not just as a design tool but as an execution multiplier—shipping working products through Claude Code and sub-agent orchestration,

**because** I am not just designing for AI; I am building with AI, giving me unique insight into what AI-native products should feel like.

**Only-ness Statement:** "I am the only design strategist who ships production code through AI orchestration while maintaining the human-centered design judgment that AI cannot replace."

**Best for:** AI-focused companies, companies undergoing AI transformation, or roles where the future of AI-assisted work is the product itself.

## 5. Risk Assessment

### Option A: Design Leader Who Ships

**Risks:**
- May be seen as "overqualified" or "unfocused" by traditional design orgs
- Coding skill might be dismissed as hobby rather than professional capability
- Could get pulled into IC engineering work when you want to lead

**Mitigations:**
- Position coding as "prototyping superpower" not "I will do engineering work"
- Emphasize design leadership outcomes, use code as proof of feasibility judgment
- Be selective about which orgs you pursue (product-focused, not design-org-empire-builders)

### Option B: The Product Builder

**Risks:**
- Market may not have established title/category for this (harder to find in job searches)
- Could be perceived as "jack of all trades, master of none"
- Some hiring managers may not believe one person can do all three well
- May attract only scrappy startups with low budgets

**Mitigations:**
- Create the category through content and positioning (this is a feature, not a bug)
- Provide concrete proof: show the startup you built, demonstrate the shipped code
- Target companies who have already experienced the pain of fragmented teams
- Price at senior specialist level, not generalist discount

### Option C: AI-Native Design Strategist

**Risks:**
- Very new category—may confuse traditional hiring processes
- Could be seen as "prompt engineer" rather than strategist
- AI hype cycle could cause backlash if market sours on AI positioning
- Skills may need constant updating as AI tools evolve

**Mitigations:**
- Ground in fundamentals: "AI-native" means you use AI as execution layer; design thinking is timeless
- Demonstrate judgment and quality of output, not just tool proficiency
- Position as "using AI to do what you already know how to do, faster"
- Target companies actively building with or for AI

## 6. Strategic Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: Option B "The Product Builder" with Option A as fallback

**Rationale:**

1. **Market Timing is Right**
   - 36% of AI startups are now solo-founded (up from 17% in 2017)
   - The "super IC" who can do multiple functions is the most in-demand profile
   - Companies are seeing AI-assisted individuals match output of 3-4 person teams
   - The Product Engineer role is emerging; Product Builder is the design-led version

2. **Your Evidence is Strong**
   - invoo.es is not hypothetical—you are actually doing this
   - DataCamp provides credibility and scale experience
   - PM year provides product strategy legitimacy
   - This is not aspirational positioning; it is descriptive

3. **Differentiation is Clear**
   - Most designers cannot code (or code poorly)
   - Most engineers cannot design (or design poorly)
   - Most cannot do either and also think strategically about product
   - You can do all three at a professional level

4. **The DataCamp Situation Validates This**
   - They are "not ready" for this model—which means you are ahead of where their org is
   - This is a feature: you should be at companies ready for this model
   - Your current employer's rejection is market signal about fit, not about you

**Secondary/Fallback Positioning:**
Keep Option A ready for opportunities at more traditional companies that interest you. Some excellent product roles at established companies may require entering through the "Design Leader" door, then demonstrating builder capabilities once inside.

## 7. Messaging Architecture

### Core Narrative

**The Big Idea:**
"The era of handoffs is over. The best products are built by people who can think, design, and ship—without waiting for anyone else."

**Supporting Pillars:**

1. **Strategic Vision** (Product thinking)
   - "I do not just design features; I define what products should exist and why"
   - Proof: PM experience, invoo.es business strategy, DataCamp product leadership

2. **Design Excellence** (Craft)
   - "7+ years of design leadership means the work is not just fast—it is good"
   - Proof: DataCamp portfolio, design system contributions, user research integration

3. **Execution Velocity** (Building)
   - "I ship production code, not just prototypes"
   - Proof: invoo.es front-end, AI-assisted development workflow, working products

### Proof Points (in order of persuasive power)

1. **invoo.es** - "I co-founded and built this. I do strategy, marketing, product, design, and ship the front-end code myself."

2. **DataCamp Lead Designer** - "I lead product design at scale, with millions of users, working with PMs and engineers."

3. **PM Experience** - "I spent a year in the PM seat. I do not just understand product thinking—I have owned it."

4. **AI Development Workflow** - "I use Claude Code with sub-agents to ship features that would traditionally require an engineering team."

### Tone Guidelines

- **Confident, not arrogant**: "I can do this" not "most people cannot"
- **Specific, not vague**: Name the tools, show the work, cite the results
- **Forward-looking, not defensive**: This is the future, not a weird exception
- **Builder mentality**: Talk about shipping, launching, creating—not planning or strategizing alone

### Key Messages by Audience

**For Startup Founders:**
"I am the first product hire who can actually make the product exist. Not wireframes, not specs—the real thing."

**For VC/Venture Studios:**
"Your portfolio companies need someone who can move at founder speed. I have done it myself."

**For Innovation Teams:**
"You need to prove concepts before you can get headcount. I can take you from idea to working product."

**For Design Leaders at Progressive Companies:**
"I am a design leader who never lost touch with building. My teams ship faster because I can prototype at production fidelity."
