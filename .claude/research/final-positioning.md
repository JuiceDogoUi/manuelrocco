## Positioning Summary

### Identity: Design Leader Who Ships

Lead with **design leadership credibility**, differentiate with **code-shipping superpower**.

This positioning:
- Works for both startups AND growth-stage companies
- Leads with proven expertise (not experimental claims)
- Uses builder capability as differentiator, not core identity
- Addresses "jack of all trades" concern by anchoring in design first

## User Input Summary

|----------|--------|-------------|
| Target audience | Keep options open | Must work for multiple company types |
| invoo.es prominence | Supporting evidence | Lead with DataCamp, invoo.es proves claims |
| Product Builder comfort | Intrigued but nervous | Safer to lead with design, builder as bonus |
| Hero's job | Both (jobs + brand) | Balance credibility + differentiation |
| Code framing | Superpower | Not normalized, not downplayed - it's the differentiator |

## Hero Messaging Framework

### Primary Headline Options

**Option A (Credibility-first):**
> "Lead Product Designer who ships code"

**Option B (Value-first):**
> "I design products. Then I build them."

**Option C (Problem-first):**

### Supporting Statement

### Proof Points (in order)

1. **DataCamp** - Scale, credibility, brand recognition
2. **Code shipping** - The differentiator (AI-augmented workflow)
3. **invoo.es** - Proves end-to-end capability is real
4. **PM experience** - Strategic depth (mention if space allows)

## Tone Guidelines

- **Confident, not arrogant**: State facts, let work speak
- **Specific, not vague**: DataCamp, invoo.es, Claude Code - name names
- **Grounded, not hypey**: Avoid AI buzzwords, focus on outcomes
- **Builder mentality**: Emphasize shipping, not just thinking

## What This Positioning Claims

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Senior design leadership | Lead Product Designer at DataCamp |
| Actually ships code | invoo.es front-end, built with Claude Code |
| Product strategy depth | 1 year as PM, co-founder decision-making |
| End-to-end capability | invoo.es: strategy → design → code → ship |

---

## What This Positioning Does NOT Claim

- "I'm an engineer" (you're a designer who can ship)
- "I replace a whole team" (you're highly effective, not superhuman)
- "Traditional design is dead" (you've evolved, not abandoned craft)
