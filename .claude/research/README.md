## Key Findings

### The Verdict: You Have a Rare & Valuable Profile

Your combination of **design leadership + PM experience + code shipping** puts you in the top 5% of candidates for growth-stage startups. This profile barely existed 18 months ago.

**Fallback:** Keep **"Design Leader Who Ships"** ready for traditional companies.

| Venture Studios | Excellent | Deploy across portfolio companies |
| AI-Native Companies | Strong | Understand the tooling shift |
| Series C+ | Good | May level lower than expected |
| FAANG | Mixed | Would hire, but at lower level |

## Positioning Statement (Draft)

> "I'm a designer who thinks like a PM and ships like an engineer. I've launched my own products, led design at a scaled EdTech company, and now I build production features using AI-augmented development. I'm looking for a company where the walls between design, product, and engineering are thin—or don't exist."
